# VMware to OCI Migration Assessment

Local Flask app for assessing VMware workload migration paths to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

It compares estimated OCI infrastructure and licensing run-rate for:

- OCI Native
- Oracle Cloud VMware Solution (OCVS)
- Hybrid: OCI Native plus OCVS

This tool is for migration-path assessment and price comparison. It is not a final quote, OCI Cost Estimator replacement, or full TCO/business-case model. Final sizing and pricing must be validated with official Oracle tools before customer sign-off.

## Main Capabilities

- Import VM inventory from RVTools exports.
- Select the VMs included in the assessment.
- Check OCI Native OS support.
- Estimate OCI Native compute, storage, VPU, and Windows license-included costs.
- Estimate OCVS node count, shape, datastore cost, and optional VCF license exposure.
- Model Hybrid placement between OCI Native and OCVS, marking VMs not supported on OCI Native for OCVS while still allowing manual placement.
- Compare monthly, annual, and 3-year price signals.
- Export a presentation-ready Excel assessment workbook.

## Quick Start

Use these steps to run the app locally on macOS or Windows.

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.9 or newer
- Git
- A terminal application:
  - macOS: Terminal
  - Windows: PowerShell

This project is available as a public GitHub repository. The app still runs locally on each user's own computer at `127.0.0.1` to ensure all data stays locally and under control of the user of this tool.

If Git is not installed, download the repository ZIP from GitHub, unzip it, and open a terminal in the extracted folder.

### macOS

Clone the repository:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
mkdir -p Projects
cd Projects
git clone https://github.com/RichardORCL/VMware2OCI.git
cd vmware-to-oci-migration-assessment
```

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the app:

```bash
MIGRATION_ASSESSMENT_PORT=5059 python app.py
```

Open the app:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5059/
```

To stop the app, return to Terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.

If port `5059` is already in use, choose another port:

```bash
MIGRATION_ASSESSMENT_PORT=5058 python app.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5058/
```

### Windows

Open PowerShell, then clone the repository:

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\Documents
mkdir Projects -Force
cd Projects
git clone https://github.com/RichardORCL/VMware2OCI.git
cd vmware-to-oci-migration-assessment
```

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, run this once in the same PowerShell window, then activate again:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the app:

```powershell
$env:MIGRATION_ASSESSMENT_PORT="5059"
python app.py
```

Open the app:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5059/
```

To stop the app, return to PowerShell and press `Ctrl + C`.

If port `5059` is already in use, choose another port:

```powershell
$env:MIGRATION_ASSESSMENT_PORT="5058"
python app.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5058/
```

### Run From an Existing Folder

If you already downloaded or cloned the project, open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## Basic Workflow

1. **Setup & Inventory**
   - Name the assessment and enter the customer or project name.
   - Select, upload, or download an OCI price list.
   - Import RVTools inventory or create a manual sizing summary.
   - Save locally, load an earlier assessment, or import a portable assessment JSON file.

2. **Inventory Review**
   - Review warnings and filter directly to affected VMs.
   - Include or exclude VMs and assign Native, OCVS, or Review placement.
   - Apply bulk placement with Undo, then save the reviewed inventory.
   - Edit manual VM count, vCPU, memory, storage, and operating-system mix without starting over.

3. **Scenario Configuration**
   - Tune OCI Native sizing and storage assumptions.
   - Configure OCVS shape, term, datastore, discount, and VCF licensing inputs.
   - Review or adjust Hybrid placement between Native and OCVS.
   - Unsupported Native VMs remain technically eligible and visible; record their remediation or migration treatment before a Native recommendation can be customer-ready.

4. **Results & Export**
   - Compare technical eligibility, pricing completeness, and modeled cost separately.
   - Select the assessor recommendation and record a customer-facing rationale.
   - Acknowledge outstanding warnings before producing customer-ready output.
   - Export a draft or customer-ready Excel workbook, or export the current assessment as portable JSON.

The lowest complete modeled price is shown as a comparison signal; the app does not automatically turn it into the assessor recommendation.

## Assessment Readiness

- **OCI Native:** Unsupported guest operating systems do not make the scenario ineligible. They create a remediation-required warning. The scenario remains rankable, but a customer-ready Native recommendation requires warning acknowledgment and a written treatment rationale.
- **OCVS and Hybrid:** VCF licensing is modeled as an optional add-on. Enter a per-core/year price to include license run-rate in OCVS and Hybrid costs; otherwise infrastructure remains rankable and license coverage is noted separately.
- **Review placement:** VMs left in Review remain visible as unresolved decisions and are conservatively modeled on OCVS until placement is confirmed.
- **Exports:** Draft Excel remains available while review items are open. Customer-ready status is granted only when the selected recommendation meets its readiness requirements.

## Saving and Sharing Assessments

- **Local saves:** Save the current assessment to the local assessment library and load it later from Setup.
- **Portable JSON:** Export the open assessment as a self-contained JSON package for backup or team sharing. Import validates the package before changing the active assessment and creates a new local copy rather than overwriting an existing save.
- **Sensitive data:** Portable packages and local saves can contain customer names, VM inventory, pricing inputs, review decisions, and recommendation rationale. Handle them as customer-sensitive files.

Word proposal generation is not included in this release. Customer-facing output is provided through the Excel assessment workbook.

## Input Files

Inventory files are discovered from:

```text
rvtools/
```

Supported formats:

- `.xlsx`
- `.xlsm`
- `.csv`

Required VM-level data:

- VM name
- vCPU
- RAM
- Storage
- Operating system

A sample file is included:

```text
rvtools/example_RVTools_tabvInfo.csv
```

## Output Files

Excel reports are written to:

```text
downloads/exports/
```

The workbook includes:

- Executive Summary
- Price Comparison
- OCI Native Analysis
- OCVS Analysis
- Hybrid Analysis
- Hybrid Placement
- Selected VMs
- Non-Selected VMs
- Price List
- Technical Details

The workbook also carries assessment-readiness and assessor-recommendation metadata. Its title and status identify whether the export is a working draft or customer-ready output.

## Local Data

The app stores local working data in:

```text
downloads/
downloads/app_state/
downloads/exports/
rvtools/
```

Treat these folders as customer-sensitive after real assessments.

## Notes

- The app is currently local-only.
- Keep it bound to `127.0.0.1`.
- Do not host it for multiple users without authentication, HTTPS, access control, and deployment hardening.
- The only outbound call is the user-initiated OCI price-list download.
